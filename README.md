# Telefono MiCasa Project Description

The **TelefonoMiCasa** application facilitates the search for apartments and houses for users interested in buying or renting properties in Asturias. It offers a personalized experience for customers, allowing them to register, complete their profile, and search for properties with detailed filters. Users can filter properties by type (apartment, house, garage, storage room), location, price range, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other criteria.

Once the user finds a property of interest, they can add it to favorites, receive notifications if the price changes, and schedule a visit. The system includes a button to contact the assigned agent and make reservations for visits with a small payment.

Additionally, users can interact with the system through voice commands, simplifying the search experience.

On the other hand, administrators and agents have specific functionalities such as user management, property assignment, and control of scheduled visits. Agents can add, modify, or delete properties, as well as see the most visited ones in their assigned areas.

The platform offers quick access to the developers' Github profiles via icons.

This application aims to provide a friendly, intuitive, and efficient experience for both users and administrators/agents.
